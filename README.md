# Mohammad Yasir
#### Physicist. Author. Developer
Hi! I majored in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology and apart from all things Physics, I have a passion for poetry and literature. In the era of intricate software, I love creating simple and minimal code. Where the world sees disorder, I see Physics at work and enjoy solving its mysteries.
